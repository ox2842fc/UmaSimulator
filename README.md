This tool is just for **algorithm learning**. Don't use it for illegal purpose.   
You can compile this tool by yourself. Change the settings in config.h, then you can evaluate the cardset strength or have a simulation game with this program.    
You can also learn the game mechanisms(such as the formula of training status gain) from the source code (mainly Game.h/cpp)

Although it's just a "very advanced calculator" which can **never change** the status of the game. Many people think this is an **"illegal tool"(不正ツール)**.    
So I would **NOT** provide more information for the installation.    
Later I will publish a **"absolutely legal"** version, whose game status is inputed **manually** so it will need no modification to the game program itself.
